what is control and data coupling  --
structure n union difference--
what is structure padding
infinite for loop , whileloop , do whileloop 
what is dead code n deactivated code?--
memory layout --
what is requirement base low level testing--
testing techniques --
v model
protocals like ARINC
documnents covered during requirment n design phasw ( Hcl question)
verification n validation--
objuectives a=66 b=65,c=57, d=28--
dangling pointer--
little endian n big endian
null pointer--
callac, malloc relloc free
MCDC--
static analysis and dynamic analysis
low level testing bugs 
why is DD is used --
why robust test cases required--
